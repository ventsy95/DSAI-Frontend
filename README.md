# DSAI - Frontend
Frontend part of collaborative project for the course Development of software for the automotive industry

## Prerequisites
Make sure you have installed all of the following prerequisites on your development machine:
* **Git** - [Download & Install Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads). OSX and Linux machines typically have this already installed.
* **Node.js** - [Download & Install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/) and the npm package manager.
* **Angular CLI** - [Install Angular CLI](https://cli.angular.io/). Both the CLI and generated project have dependencies that require *Node 6.9.0* or higher, together with *NPM 3* or higher.

## Quick Install
Once you've downloaded and installed all the prerequisites, you're just a few steps away from starting the DSAI Dashboard.

The `package.json` file contains the list of modules and dependencies you need to in order to start the UI service in your browser.

To install the dependencies, run this command in the application folder from the command-line:

```bash
npm install
```

## Development server

Run `ng serve` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

## Code scaffolding

Run `ng generate component component-name` or `ng g c component-name` to generate a new component. You can also use `ng generate directive|pipe|service|class|guard|interface|enum|module`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).

## Further help

To get more help on the Angular CLI use `ng help` or go check out the [Angular CLI README](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/blob/master/README.md).
